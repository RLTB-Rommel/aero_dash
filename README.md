# Aero Dash — Canvas Edition

## Overview
**Aero Dash** is a 2D endless-dodger game built using **HTML5 Canvas and JavaScript**. The objective is to move the player’s ship to avoid falling enemy blocks while collecting green pickups to increase score. The game becomes more difficult over time as speed and spawn frequency increase.

This project fulfills the **Game Framework Module** requirements by demonstrating:
- Rendering of graphics using Canvas
- Keyboard and touch/mouse input
- Moveable objects that interact through collision
- Game progression through score-based level scaling
- Sound effects and Best Score saving through `localStorage`

1. Open the folder in VS Code.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.
   - If using VS Code, right-click → **Open With Live Server** (recommended).
3. The game will start immediately.

## Learning Reflection (Short Summary)
In this project, I learned how to use **HTML5 Canvas** to draw and animate gameplay elements, how to capture keyboard and touch input, and how to manage game state transitions such as scoring, level scaling, and game over detection. I also learned how to use `localStorage` to store persistent high scores and how to toggle sound using the Web Audio API.
